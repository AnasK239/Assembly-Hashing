#**Important Notes**

This project doesnt contain a GUI its a single .asm file that you can run locally on MARS MIPS simulator.

The way you input the necessary parameters to the code is using the CLI command java -jar mars.jar hashing.asm pa (initial-integer-value)   

The output value will be stored in memory starting from address (0x10010000) (first data address in mars) and saved in registers $V0 and $s0
